# directus-extension-bundle-systeminfo

This extension provides a panel for displaying the system information of the Directus instance.

## Details

This project aims to get a better overview about the hosted Directus instance.
The endpoint uses the npm package `systeminformation` to retrieve the informations.

Used Directus extensions: bundle, endpoint and panel.

Next, one could further refine the presentation of the data. For example, visualize with graphs or simply format better.
The new auto-reload feature would have been nice as well, but unfortunately I haven't found any documentation in Directus about it yet.
I had to think for a while to come up with a suitable idea for the hackathon. It had to be something that Directus could still use in the future. In other words, it should bring a generic, real added value. I think the system information of the Directus host can be used for a lot of things, especially as an analysis tool for debugging or benchmarking.
